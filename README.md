## **Getting Started**

### Setup Virtual Environment

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
- On macOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
- On Windows:
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running Examples

Navigate to specific topic directories and run the Python scripts. For example:
```bash
# Run data format examples
python data_formats_and_storage/format_examples.py

# Run format conversion examples
python data_formats_and_storage/format_conversions.py
```

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Murtaza-arif/all-you-need-to-know-for-data-engineer.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd data-engineering-repo
   ```
3. Follow the instructions in each topic folder's `README.md` file to explore examples and projects.
